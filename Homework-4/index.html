            <h1> A description of <em>The Stranger</em> </h1>
            <p><em>L’Étranger (The Outsider</em> [UK], or The <em>Stranger</em> [US]) is a 1942 novel by French author Albert Camus. Its theme and outlook are often cited as examples of Camus's philosophy of the absurd and existentialism, though Camus personally rejected the latter label.
            </p>



            <h2> A description of <em>What We Talk About When We Talk About Love</em> </h2>
              <p><em>What We Talk About When We Talk About Love</em>is a 1981 collection of short stories by American writer Raymond Carver, as well as the title of one of the stories in the collection. </p>


            <h3> A description of <em>Down and Out in Paris and London</em></h3>
              <p> <em>Down and Out in Paris and London</em> is the first full-length work by the English author George Orwell, published in 1933. It is a memoir[2] in two parts on the theme of poverty in the two cities. The first part is an account of living in near-destitution in Paris and the experience of casual labour in restaurant kitchens. The second part is a travelogue of life on the road in and around London from the tramp's perspective, with descriptions of the types of hostel accommodation available and some of the characters to be found living on the margins.</p>
